# tronlang
Tronlang interpreter written in Golang and C
initial created to facility access to datastructures. Includes a general tree call the world tree because it's gobal. Hash tables are supported through short tables (which has limited capacity.). A global graph is implemented as a digraph and can find shortest paths with the Belman-ford algorithm
simply go build tron.go
If you need a C compiler that works with windows you can install gcc provided by strawberry perl (https://strawberryperl.com/)
